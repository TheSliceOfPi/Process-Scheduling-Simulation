README


This project contains one main program with many components.
The command 'make all' will compile the entire project. Alternatively, you
may compile according to the directions below.

---schedulesim---
To compile: make schedulesim
To run: ./schedulesim <number of CPUBound Processes> <number of IOBound Processes> <number of Cycles>
Description:
schedulesim creates four different schedulers: RoundRobin, FastRoundRobin, CompletelyFair, and FastCompletelyFair. RoundRobin and FastRoundRobin following the round robin scheduling strategy, while CompletelyFair and FastCompletelyFair following the completely fair scheduling strategy. schedulesim then calls simulate on each scheduler to determine the average runtime of the simulation ,average CPU time, and  Wait Time for CPU bounds and IO bound processes, in each Scheduler.
Known issues:
-None that I know of.

#timing.pdf and cputimes.pdf are files meant to show comparison between the scheduler algorithms and are not needed for the simulation.
#Additional files are basic approaches or practice code to get to the final project version.
